Hey, this is [@ciphrd](https://twitter.com/ciphrd) the author of fxhash. fxhash is currently in beta mode. These are a few notes to inform you about:
 - how to help in improving the platform (bug reports, feature requests, suggestions)
 - the risks of using the platform in its current state


## Help fxhash

If you are interested in helping me to build this project, first of all **thank you for your interest, it truly means a lot**. Since I am still new in writing application for/with blockchains, there will certainly be at least a few iterations over this current version before it reaches a stable state. From my numerous tests, I didn't find any problematic bug, but I am certainly missing some edge cases which you can help identify.

I am also very interested to hear your thoughts about the platform, let it be conceptual or technical. I built fxhash because I wanted such a tool to exist for myself, as a generative artist. Feedback from your experience using it will help me understand what you need from this tool.

I opened a discord for you to report bugs. I think discord will work best in this case because some bugs sometimes require some back-and-forth. Also I think this could be a great way to exchange ideas about the future of the platform. I'm hoping to reach a point were fxhash will be driven by its community, so Discord might be a good place to start gathering people interested.

## The risks

The platform was released very recently and so I do not guarantee that every feature will work as intended. The project is not fully stable yet, and so there might be a point where some updates require the contracts to be updated and the data to be fully erased. I'm hoping that contracts won't need to be updated, and it could very well be the case. However I think you need to know about this eventual issue. I think it could be great to keep the prices low so that people can experiment and test your tokens.
