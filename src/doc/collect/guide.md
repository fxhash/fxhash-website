# Interact with the Tezos blockchain

In order to interact with the Smart Contracts of **fxhash**, you will need to have a tezos wallet. You can find a of [available wallets on the tezos website](https://tezos.com/learn/store-and-use/).

We recommend [Temple](https://templewallet.com/) (browser extension) or [Kukai](https://wallet.kukai.app/) (website).

Once you have a wallet and a tezos address on it, you can synchronize your wallet with fxhash by clicking on the _sync_ button. You will need to send tezos to your address in order to purchase tokens on the platform. It can be done through various exchange platforms, such as [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/en/how-to-buy/tezos), [kraken](https://www.kraken.com/en-gb/learn/buy-tezos-xtz) or [coinhouse](https://www.coinhouse.com/buy-tezos/) for instance.
