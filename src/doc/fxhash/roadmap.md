*This roadmap will provide a general view of the plans for the development of fxhash during the following months.*


## Stabilizing the platform

The first objective is to have the platform in a *stable state*, with all the most necessary features implemented. To have all the basics covered, as well as a consistent UI/UX across the website, with a particular focus on the onboarding of new users. 


## New Smart Contract features

Once the beta platform reaches a stable state, we will start implementing the next iteration of Smart Contracts, and their integration into the main website. This step includes the audit of such contracts to ensure security of our users over time.

The new Smart Contracts will provide most of the desired features, as most of them require an upgrade of the contracts. The integration of the new contracts into the indexer, API, and front-end will also play an important part as old contracts will have to co-exist along the new ones.

The [FXH Token and the main DAO](/doc/community/token-dao) will be implemented during this stage, and they should provide some very solid basis for the future of the platform.


## Preparation for the release

1 week prior to the release, we will close the publishing of new projects. During this week, people will be able to mint iterations from these projects. After this last minting week, beta projects will be locked and no more iterations will be mintable. They will reach their final state of **Beta projects**.

This week will be utilized by the team to deploy the new contracts, architecture, and carefully test that everything runs as originally intended.

The main [fxhash.xyz](https://fxhash.xyz) website will point to the beta platform for the last time during this stage.


## Public release (estimation: 15/03/2022)

After 4 months, some chaotic debuts, thousands of projects posted by hundreds of wonderful artists, fxhash will exit its beta phase.

Once the contract features will be properly integrated, carefully tested, [fxhash.xyz](https://fxhash.xyz) will be moved to the released platform. 

The release will include all the new contract features, as well as the [FXH Token and the main DAO](/doc/community/token-dao). It will include the cohabitation between the beta projects/tokens and the new projects/tokens. 


## Curated Spaces

[More on the curated spaces](/doc/community/curation)

The focus after the release will be the implementation of the curated spaces. The first iteration of curated spaces should already provide enough features for fxhash to have a much more robust form. 

- develop the Smart Contract to support Curated Spaces
- integration of the Curated Spaces into the front end, with a particular focus on the exploration of content through those spaces

We originally wanted to release it along with the FXH token, but we eventually realized that this update would be too important to be deployed at once. We’d rather provide some smaller layers of iteration since this is a more effective way to improve the project.


## TreeDAO

[More on the TreeDAO architecture](/doc/community/treedao)

The next milestone following the curated spaces will be to implement the TreeDAO architecture. 

This milestone will have 2 major focuses:

- actual implementation of the Smart Contracts responsible for supporting TreeDAO architecture (subDAO factory)
- facilitate the creation and utilisation of the subDAOs from the front end interface
