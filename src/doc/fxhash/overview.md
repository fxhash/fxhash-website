# What is fxhash ?

**fxhash** is an open platform where artists can publish Generative Tokens which are stored on the [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) blockchain. Generative Tokens are programs designed to produce random outputs. Once a Generative Token is enabled (_when the artist decides it_), anyone with a tezos wallet can mint its own unique iteration of the Generative Token. Each iteration produces a unique piece that is stored as a NFT on the tezos blockchain. The NFTs are FA2 compliant, which means that they can be exchanged like any other NFT everywhere in the tezos ecosystem.

Glossary:

- `Generative Art`: refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system; in the context of fxhash: art produced with computer code
- `Generative Token`: code based projects published by generative artists on fxhash
- `Iterations`: unique output of a fxhash project; each piece minted from a project is an iteration

# Control left to the artists

The philosophy of fxhash is simple: provide a framework so that generative artists can have a space in which they can mint their pieces meant to be generative. **No curation, open to everyone**.

# What happens when we mint one iteration of a Generative Token ?

A random hash is generated, and injected into the project provided by the artist. Then, the project is stored immutably on the blockchain. This design ensures that each token generated is **independent**, **self-contained**, and **immutable**. If fxhash were to go down, owners of fxhash tokens could still open their tokens and see it in their own browsers. Also, virtual galleries can safely display the tokens as real-time art pieces as the token is simply hosted on the IPFS network.
